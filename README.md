edx Introduction to NodeJS: Assignment 4
=====

This project is my solution to the 4th assignment at edX Introduction to Node.js course, a persistent Express REST API server with MongoDB and the Mongoose native driver, with a simple front-end to test the API.

```
$ npm i 
$ npm start 
```

### 1. Why did I design this project the way I did?

To comply with the requirements for the assignment. I just added a few checks on passed IDs (so the server can respond properly on malformed ids or not-existent documents).

### 2. How did I test?

I checked the entries on the mongodb instance, tested with curl and via browser (through the sample front-end). 

### 3. Known issues

All fine.
